**To: Wey (Siwei) Gu & Lynn Bender**


Dear Lynn and Wey,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. As recent additions to my LinkedIn network, I’ve admired your contributions and wondered if we could embark on an exciting collaboration.

**Motivation:**  
While preparing to share a recent article on RAM-based GNNs - Amazon Researchers Introduce DistTG, I realized its relevance to my previous posts. The current LinkedIn design, however, doesn't facilitate easy referencing of such connected content.

**Context:**  
LinkedIn, in its current state, encourages fast-paced, buzzword-heavy content, often neglecting the depth and interconnectedness of knowledge. Rather than building on previous insights or referencing established knowledge (standing on the shoulders of giants), content risks becoming ephemeral and redundant.

**Solution:**  
It's time for platforms like LinkedIn, and potentially others like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, to evolve. Imagine a version-controlled system, akin to Git, manifesting as a knowledge graph on LinkedIn.

**Proof:**  
By harnessing graph theory, we can utilize hashtags as edges and topic embeddings as nodes. The post's content can serve as neighboring nodes, creating a knowledge-rich network. This approach facilitates better connectivity between topics and in-depth discussions.

**Approach:**  
I've created a video demonstration using the Nebula Graph, which ingests my LinkedIn posts, rendering a visual knowledge network. The underlying engine powers this visualization.

**Collaboration Request:**  
I am eager to explore this idea further with your expertise. I have a Python class ready that extracts user post content from the official LinkedIn API. However, I lack the partner status required to query member post content. Your association and insights could bridge this gap.

The prospect of reimagining LinkedIn's UI and algorithm with your collaboration excites me. Together, we can bring depth, interconnectivity, and a renewed sense of purpose to content sharing.

I await your thoughts.

Warm regards,

Kilian

After some discussions with colleagues & friends and diving into the videos attached, I've come to believe that a transformative approach is on the horizon for companies with more than 1000 employees. Regardless of the platform - be it [#arangodb](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=arangodb&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7107439258352640001), [#neo4j](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=neo4j&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7107439258352640001), or [#aws](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=aws&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7107439258352640001) [#neptune](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=neptune&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7107439258352640001) - the foundational strategy remains consistent:  
  
1. Data Lake | Data Warehouse | DBs: The bedrock of data storage and management.  
  
2. ELT | ETL: A robust digestion layer that seamlessly integrates the different levels of structure.  
  
3. Feature-Store: An essential layer I'd introduce between the digestion and graph database. This acts as a bridge for User Memory Retrieval, Suggestion Storage, and Version Control Implementation. Its primary role?  
  
--> To intuitively model the problem spaces of team members, ensuring a more personalized and efficient data interaction. <--  
  
4. Graph-DB: This maps data relationships, providing a comprehensive view of interconnected information. It can also be useful for rebalancing the embeddings-space in context.

🌱 A Greener Future: Exploring the Impact of Straw Houses on the Carbon Footprint  
1. Short Summary:  
With climate change at the forefront of global challenges, innovative solutions are needed more than ever. Building homes with straw could be one such solution, subtracting CO2 from the atmosphere rather than adding to it. This project explores the potential of straw houses to reduce the carbon footprint of the housing industry, considering factors like degradation over time and exponential growth in straw house construction.  
2. See Video Below:  
Want to understand the concept better? Watch this video from [Patagonia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/patagonia_2/) Founder Yvon Chouinard, providing insights into the idea of building with straw and its environmental benefits. [https://lnkd.in/egyVAKxq](https://lnkd.in/egyVAKxq)  
3. See App to Dig Deeper:

In 2020, I dedicated my BA thesis to delve deep into the realm of data-driven decisions in response to the climate crisis. The introduction to my thesis read:  
  
"In response to the climate debate, data-driven decisions are increasingly relied upon in Europe. These technocratic decisions (as they are often called in a political context)(cf. Radaelli, 2017) are behind national sanctions like the ones in force in the German city Stuttgart for exceeding the threshold value for air pollution. Because of the all-englobing nature of the problem of climate change, nearly every sector (primary, secondary and tertiary sector) of the economy is touched. But do all stakeholders in these sectors have access to reliable data? Does any citizen, policy maker, or scientist in Europe have access to consistent and reliable data? Does the mayor of a small village in Germany have access to the same environmental data as a policy maker in the EU or any other mayor in the EU. These questions are addressed in the work at hand for the member states France and Germany. The accessibility of data is critically necessary for the social acceptance of the legislation of increasingly stringent environmental measures (cf. Carrete et al., 2012). This principle dovetails with one of the main principles of the Balanced-Scorecard-Topic: ” If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. ”(Kaplan and David, 2000, p. 21) or in this context: you can’t make effective managerial decisions without reliable access to consistent data.”  
  
You can find the complete thesis here: [https://lnkd.in/eNMHySsr](https://lnkd.in/eNMHySsr)  
  
I'm gratified to see that innovative start-ups like Regionalwert Research: [https://lnkd.in/ek4eikJF](https://lnkd.in/ek4eikJF) and the promising @Isometric [https://lnkd.in/es_Raq82](https://lnkd.in/es_Raq82) are harnessing the power of data to make informed decisions. These organizations are paving the way to a future where data accessibility isn't a privilege but a norm.  
  
Let's empower everyone, from policy-makers to citizens, with the data they need to make informed decisions about our planet's future.

I beg your indulgence as I once again delve into the delightful realm of analogy-laden musings (honestly, i have the best time and i guess you guys have to suffer :D ):  
  
🎬 Like the characters in 'Inception' and 'Predestination', I navigate through layers of reality - only, my layers are not dreams or timelines, but data-sets and tables in DBs. In our latest project, I've designed a class, which weaves through these data-scapes, building views, fetching the latest tables, and generating summaries for reports.  
  
Our raw data reports remain static, a frozen snapshot of a moment in time. Just as in quantum theory, where a particle's state isn't determined until it's observed (principle of superposition), our raw data only unfolds its patterns and trends when the view is invoked.  
  
Just as a clockmaker peers into the intricate labyrinths of cogs and springs, refining their dance within the heart of a timepiece, I too navigate the maze of data in the realm of temporal dimensions.  
  
Or just as the agents in '[#inception](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=inception&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7077670585358528512)' create their dream world, my class generates temporary tables from these views, crafting a unique vision of the data landscape.  
It's like navigating through a world that is constantly being rewritten, much like how the time agent's actions constantly reshaped his timeline in 'Predestination'(Prudhvee Krishna Nalluri, thx. mate!👌🎥).  
He voyages through the weft and weave of time to thwart calamities before they occur. Similar to him, I delve into the intricacies of the most recent data tables to identify and mitigate any potential issues before they occur.  
  
In the end, we form a dance between creation and destruction, viewing and refreshing, much like the ebb and flow of time in our sci-fi thrillers. It's an intricate game that transforms raw, unobserved data into rich, meaningful insights, ready to drive decision-making in this ever-evolving data-driven world.

Hello Weekend-Hustlers! 🌐  
Straight from the heart of the Four Corners of Civilization, I'm going to share an opinionated process-approach that's been my Fae companion in the treacherous journey through the coding Edema Ruh troupe.  
Use-Case: Think of projects that resemble the intricate harmony between the Arcanum and the University, where the silent communication between an Artificer and their Kilvin is crucial, and our Sympathy links with monitoring and testing are our saving grace.  
Consider the following as a pseudo-code class: TheKingKillerChronicle. This is an epic saga, not unlike Kvothe's own tale, where each class and function is a character. The story revolves around dancing with the ever-lurking Cthaeh, AKA Conway's Law, without being bitten.  
Class TheKingKillerChronicle inherits from RuhLore:  
🔹 Method 1 - Design Workshop: Like young Kvothe learning the Edema Ruh's ways, our Sympathist class acquires domain-specific terms from the stakeholder. Learning outcomes, SLAs, and value errors are etched in the Waystone Inn's ledger, in our case, UML. This is where our tale begins, a common tongue is agreed upon, and we lay the groundwork for our defense against the Cthaeh's prophecies.  
🔹 Method 2 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Picture this as Elodin's Naming class, granting first-class citizenship to your infrastructure in the realm of code. Whether it's the primal essence of Terraform or the syntactic consistency of CloudFormation, your infrastructure will hum along like the wind called by a namer.  
🔹 Method 3 - Meta-Decorator: This is like a more versatile version of Mola's careful administrations in the Medica - a log_and_test() function on a potent alchemical mixture. From translating SLAs into tangible elements and monitoring them like the Masters watch the Crockery, to configuring errors and redundancies, this method is as meticulous as a well-performed Binding.  
🔹 Method 4 - Architecture Feedback Loop: The grand finale, the closing notes of Kvothe's lute at the Eolian. We convene with stakeholders, our resolution map in hand, and hold it up to the golden standard set in the Design Workshop. With print(help(ClassOne)) as our lens, we refine it until it becomes a song that will echo through the centuries.  
Check out the attached UML diagram for a glimpse into our saga, in a form even the Archives couldn't misplace.  
In the end, the most skilled Shapers aren't just those fluent in the arcane languages of code, but also those adept in the arts of communication, planning, and feedback. As they say in the Commonwealth, may all your stories be glad ones! 🍻

Mind following aspects when starting training & fine tuning [#LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=llms&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7051614286724395008):  
1. Don't waste time and money and try and run a [#LLM](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=llm&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7051614286724395008) on a notebook, you will get cuda out of memory errors all the time, because the cuda driver doesnt know how to handle multiple notebooks or even if you open a console etc. it will have problems. And dont get me started on server disconnects :D  
2. If you go for an instance, go for the g-family in [#ec2](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=ec2&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7051614286724395008), the p-family gave me problems with the [#cuda](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=cuda&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7051614286724395008) driver  
3. Start to understand the connection between mirco-batches, RAM and learning-rate, if not your convergance gonna mess up your results  
4. Start to parallelize your LLM training and fine tuning, espacially if you run one more than one gpu, if not your money will be waisted on the other gpus.

I fine tuned like a dozen [#openai](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=openai&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7046189214668836864) models (ada, davinci, curie etc.), in all of them i got:  
  
Job complete! Status: succeeded 🎉  
... but one:  
Job complete! Status: succeeded ð���  
  
Anyone any idea what Eth ( ð) is doing there? :D  
  
One further note here:  
You can further fine tune your already fine tuned models. So you can basically fine tune model a for agency a and model b for agency b and then you make model c based on agency model a and b and so you can build your company-knowledge-[#ai](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=ai&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7046189214668836864) in a layered logic.  
  
And here a small batch script so you're not stuck in a queue while fine tuning:D  
  
#!/usr/bin/expect -f  
  
# set the timeout to 1 second  
set timeout 1  
  
# define the command to be run  
set COMMAND "openai api fine_tunes.follow -i ft-XXX"  
  
# spawn a new shell and start the command  
spawn sh  
  
send "$COMMAND\n"  
  
# continuously monitor the console output for "disconnect"  
while true {  
expect {  
-re ".*disconnect.*" {  
# if "disconnect" is found, run the command again  
puts "Connection lost! Reconnecting..."  
send "$COMMAND\n"  
}  
timeout {  
# wait for 1 second before checking again  
sleep 1  
}  
}  
}

For all of you who had to do hard string operations with high server costs in the past. These days are over, thanks to [#openai](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=openai&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7040370029950873601)  
Go for Fine-Tuning: [https://lnkd.in/dK2jWTgr](https://lnkd.in/dK2jWTgr)  
  
Your models will appear afterwards in the playground and you can use them in your apis.  
  
Pitfalls at the moment:  
1. Could solve nor find solution for following error:  
'The number of classes in file does not match the number of classes specified in the hyperparameters.'  
2. You will have a lot of server disconnect messages and you will be stuck in a queu for a few minutes

Hi, I have developed an app based on [REWE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rewe/) [REWE Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rewegroup/) E-Bon, because unfortunately you can only get it as a pdf via the rewe app and only aggergated by purchase trip as csv, but I wanted to have the listing of products via csv. You can use the app to convert the receipt into a csv and if you want to do me something good, you can also provide it to me. Mind that it's still in Beta. More here:

Thus, as a customer of [comdirect – eine Marke der Commerzbank AG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/comdirect-bank/) I'm grateful, that you have an api (see [https://lnkd.in/e7jp4WwV](https://lnkd.in/e7jp4WwV)).  
  
But would you pls. make a read-only / reporting access with the chance to auto auth. instead of just giving the chance to make a read & WRITE access to a private online account? :D  
As a banchmark you can take [Wise](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wiseaccount/), they did it right ;P  
  
--> Updt.: Found a nice workaround: use [https://lnkd.in/eqsVzZrR](https://lnkd.in/eqsVzZrR) , they use the api nicely and we're out of the risky "own dev" scope.

Here's a beautiful example that kept me awake the whole night:  
  
I asked [#DALL·E](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=dall%C2%B7e&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6989759032395735040):  
"the discours between the Standard Model of Particle Physics with the subatomic particle physics interpreted out of the Langlands program perspective of uniting number theory and geometry represented in a graphical color mix"

In the off chance, that you work with x>2 TB in pyspark (look below), if not, stop reading HERE, be happy and enjoy the summer :)  
   
1. Use zeppelin notebook instead of jupyter (if you don't believe me, try to cache in a jupyter nb. More then 2 Tb, if you manage, write me)  
  
2. Use highmem instances if you work on gcp (mind your budget)  
  
3. Set memory config to x>64g (if you have enough worker nodes), if not, you get a buffer overflow (especially if you do string ops.) [thx. to exodus-intelligence to put me on the topic]  
  
4. Cache() the data you want to work with (cache and sample, then checkpoint by saving to bucket, then read in and cache again in case you want to make some fancy visualization)  
  
5. Before you start with any modelling at all, try to reduce the dimensions (your columns/ variables) as far as possible (use pairplot to get a first idea, then go for pca, plot dimensions as overlay to datapoints)  
   
Thx. To FN, SG, InS for those insights.  
   
P.S. If there is anybody out there, who managed to run sparklyr on a zeppelin notebook, pls. Write me, I will buy you a bottle of wine (or juice).
